# My Awesome Project
Hello, this is "CoffeeDash", a full-stack delivery application utilizing the DoorDash Drive API. Ideally it would be used for a physical or online store that wants the ability to deliver their products to their customers on the same day.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

When I improve this project, I would update my media queries with a mobile-first approach, add local data storage for the delivery ID/tracking, and create an error alert when the distance is too far for delivery.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use the DoorDash Drive API effectively.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
